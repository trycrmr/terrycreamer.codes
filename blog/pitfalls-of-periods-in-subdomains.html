        <section class="tldr">
          TL;DR: Using periods in subdomains adds complexity to SSL/TLS certificate management and
          cannot be used more than four times
          (<span class="breakWords">fourthLabel.thirdLabel.secondLabel.firstLabel.domain.top-LevelDomain</span>). Using hyphens can
          accommodate most existing, contextual (i.e. "your company's...") naming conventions and is
          easily scalable from a SSL/TLS certificate management perspective. Any trade offs are easily
          mitigated.
        </section>
        <p>
          This summer I have been putting an online course together. As is prudent for publishing
          anything on the internet that's pedagogical I am double and triple checking my choices align with industry
          standards and best practices. At one point the course demonstrates creating several
          non-production environments with associated pipelines, automation, and other accoutrements. I
          want the hostnames of these environments to align as clearly as possible with how I would
          reference them verbally. In the workplace I've accomplished this partially by separating "words"
          in the hostname with periods. When the URL was sent to others, particularly non-technical folks,
          the URL would be semantic enough to clearly reflect the purpose of the environment, such as
          [Product Name].[Environment Type].[Company Name].[Top-level Domain] (i.e. <span class="italics">companywiki.testing.bigcorp.com</span>) . This provided clarity to folks in the workplace who could be working with tens of products at a time or more 
          (change management folks, middle managers, security professionals, etc. ). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Little did I know
          using periods sets one up for significant additional complexity in managing TLS/SSL certificates
          for non-prod environments and significantly limits naming convention possibilities (gasp!). Most
          industry content around naming is the different, contextual naming conventions teams have
          come up with. I didn't come across content about translating these naming conventions into
          hostnames while avoiding traps (cue​ <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=admiral+ackbar+its+a+trap&oq=admiral+ackbar+its+a+trap" aria-label="A link to a google search of Admiral Ackbar from Star Wars saying 'It's a trap!'">Admiral Ackbar</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Environment hostname naming conventions can be scaled with one SSL/TLS certificate (i.e.
          "cert") up to one 63 character subdomain, presuming the cert has a 
          wildcarded subdomain (i.e. <span class="italics">*.domain.top-levelDomain</span>). Any use of periods in the subdomain will create another ​<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt" aria-label="Link to the IETF's RFC1035 that discusses Domain Names">"label" (also called a
          "fragment", example: label.domain.top-LevelDomain)</a>​. Each one of these labels can have up to
          63 characters, however the total of all the labels, plus the periods that separate them, plus the
          domain name, plus the top-level domain cannot exceed 253 characters. In other words,
          <span class="italics">label4.label3.label2.label1.domain.top-LevelDomain</span> must be less than 253 characters. An example
          of a 63 character valid label would be   "what-is-a-ballons-least-favorite-genre-of-music----pop-hahahaha".
          Seems like that's long enough to accommodate most company naming convention use cases if it can accommodate smart speaker jokes!
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://serverfault.com/a/946120/443716" aria-label="Link to a ServerFault answer discussing what wildcarding is allowed in hostname labels"> Any label after the first will not be covered by the SSL/TLS certificate that has a wildcard on the
          first label​</a> (*gasps again*!). Approached from another angle, if you want to have more than one
          label in a hostname, you need to have a SSL/TLS certificate that denotes what the first label
          should be with a wildcard for the second label (i.e. <span class="italics">*.labelOne.domain.top-levelDomain</span>). The
          same is true for wildcarding the third or fourth label, each with a separate, properly "wildcarded" TLS/SSL certificate. This is where competent certificate management comes in if you want to
          scale your company's naming convention to cover multiple labels.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, <strong>I'd put forward an adequate alternative approach to using periods in subdomains is to use hyphens instead of periods
          in your first label. This will allow you up to 63 characters to express the environment with the
          hostname's first label, allowing you to encrypt communications over all the environments using one
          SSL/TLS certificate.</strong> Cue third gasp, standing ovation, and profits! You're welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The total amount of string permutations is quite a large number. I posted a​ <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3341434/combination-where-length-can-be-anything-up-to-a-limit" aria-label="A link to my Math Stack Exchange question about calculating the number of string permutations a label could have.">Math Stack Exchange question asking how to get this number</a>. Here's some scrappy JavaScript that resulted in <number>6.435878542419158e+98</number> permutations:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
​const firstLoop = 36; <br />
// ^36 because Hypens can't begin a label <br />
const otherLoops = 37; <br />
const maxLabelLength = 63; <br />
let sum = 0; <br />
for(let i=1; i<=maxLabelLength; i++) { <br />
  &ensp; sum += i==0 <br />
  &ensp;&ensp; ? firstLoop ** i <br />
  &ensp;&ensp; : otherLoops ** i <br />
}; <br />
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Either
          way, it's one of those numbers that's so big it's tough to represent. This number is effectively
          doubled as a second label is wildcarded and associated with a specific first label
          (<span class="italics">*.specificFirstLabel.domain.top-levelDomain</span>). Obviously, all of these naming permutations
          wouldn't be practical. I dare you, reader, to make a list of the practical ones! Lol jk, don't worry about it. But if you do let me know; That would be a fun browse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The approach of using hyphens instead of periods in hostnames naming conventions of
          non-prod environments allows for:
            <ul>
              <li>Enough creative surface area for contextualized naming conventions in the subdomain</li>
              <li>Secure communications with the simplest TLS/SSL certificate management approach possible
                  (i.e. only one, maybe two TLS/SSL certs to manage (two if you want to separate production &
                  non-production TLS/SSL certificates)</li>
              <li>Is easily scalable by adding a TLS/SSL certificate for a specific first label with a "wildcarded" second label</li>
              <li>Can accommodate any current naming convention that doesn't typically exceed 63 characters</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          One can pay for "​<a href="https://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/wildcard-san-names.htm" aria-label="Link to Subject Alternative Names service offering by a Certificate Authority">Subject Alternative Names​</a>", which is a service I saw provided by at least one Certificate
          Authority. It basically abstracts the certificate management, making it appear as if you're able
          to use nested wildcards of labels without additional certificates. It is a way to solve this problem
          with money. With so many permutations offered within the 63-character label limit I'd posit most
          IT budgets could find better uses for the money.
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppose teams could choose to use HTTP for their non-production environments to forego the
          certificate management altogether. Is that really a wise choice though? Besides sending visible
          web traffic and opting out of environment parity with production, <a href="https://www.ssl.com/article/an-introduction-to-http2/" aria-label="Link to article about all major browsers not supporting HTTP/2 unless it's over SSL/TLS" all modern browsers are
          apparently only supporting HTTP/2 over SSL/TLS​ according to this article​ (note that only Firefox
          is sourced directly though). For web applications <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2#Goals" aria-label="A link to the benefits of using HTTP/2">any benefits of HTTP/2​</a> in non-production environments can only be used by serving non-production environments over HTTPS. So sure, it's an option. Is
          managing one TLS/SSL certificate really too much to ask in lieu of all these gains? Enjoy that
          Friday deployment when you learn the hard way you have external assets that are referenced using HTTP
          URLs.

          Arguably, the hyphen is only for readability. One could forego including hyphens to save
          characters if the 63 character label limit can't accommodate some longer, hopefully edge case
          naming conventions. My guess is the semantic exchange would not be worth it though as...

          That's 64 characters,
          but you get the point. Literally had to format that string to break over multiple lines to keep it from messing up the user interface of this blog post on mobile. Add accommodating huge, single-line strings in company interfaces to the growing list of negatives.  
        </p>
        <p>
          For brevity's sake, here's a list of some trade offs to using one SSL/TLS certificate for securing
          multiple environment hostnames:
          <ol>
            <li>If the private key of your SSL/TLS certificate is compromised all HTTPS communication
                transmitted using that certificate could have been compromised and a new SSL/TLS certificate should be rolled out to all environments ASAP. A mitigation is to have two separate SSL/TLS certificates for production
                      (<span class="italics">domain.top-LevelDomain</span> & <span class="italics">www.domain.top-LevelDomain</span>) and non-prod
                      environments (<span class="italics">*.domain.top-LevelDomain</span>). Secure them adequately, but separately.</li>
            <li>Any issues with SSL/TLS renewal will effect all environments. A mitigation is to automatically renew SSL/TLS certificates at a third of their expiration
                      lifespan, at least, and confirm the certificate is actually renewed at a similar frequency.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hope this sheds some light on the consequences of a seemingly harmless and intuitive choice
          to use periods in subdomains! Hyphens for the win!
